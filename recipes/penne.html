    <h3>How to Make Homemade Penne Alla Vodka</h3>
    <p>Here are some tips and tricks for making the perfect pasta alla vodka from the chef herself </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can skip the pancetta if you want to make this a meatless meal, according to culinary producer and recipe creator Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcmom). But, if you want to go in the opposite direction, Italian sausage would also work well.</li>
        <li>Don't skip the tomato paste! It adds a deep, rich flavor that makes this penne alla vodka impossible to resist. Make sure to cook it until it takes on a brownish color.</li>
        <li>Nicole uses whole canned and peeled tomatoes because she finds they have better flavor than pre-crushed tomatoes. She also crushes them with her hands the old-fashioned way!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Yields 6 servings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 ounces pancetta, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>⅔ cup vodka</li>
        <li>1 pound rigatoni or penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon pepper, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>⅔ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place a large pot of salted water over high heat to bring to a boil. Pour tomatoes in a medium bowl and crush well with hands or chop in a food processor. Set aside.</li>
        <li>While water heats, prepare the sauce: Heat oil and pancetta in a large saucepan or deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently until pancetta is crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring constantly, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until the tomato paste has taken on a slight brownish color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add vodka and cook until reduced by at least half. Stir in reserved tomatoes and juices and bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While sauce reduces, add pasta to boiling water and cook, according to package directions until al dente, 11 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once sauce is reduced, stir in heavy cream and pepper and cook for 3 minutes, stirring often. Stir in 1/3 cup cheese, parsley, basil and pasta until well combined. Season with additional salt and pepper if desired.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with remaining cheese and more herbs if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
